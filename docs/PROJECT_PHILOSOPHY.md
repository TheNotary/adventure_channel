# Project Philosophy

Features and units of code are welcome and well implemented if they lead up to AdventureChannel being closely similar to the way Final Fantasy games are done (in particular, FF2 SNES).  

Code is high quality if it is highly readable or if it is well documented meta-programming that saves hundreds of lines of code.  

Features and units of code are high quality if they don't break existing tests unless those other tests passed in an architecturally flawed state of code and should be re-written anyway.
