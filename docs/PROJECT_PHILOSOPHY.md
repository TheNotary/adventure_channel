# Project Philosophy

Thesis:
- Hackerspaces can be strengthened in membership, interconnectivity, and cultural growth through the use of open source, casual, multiplayer gaming software and electronic communication mechanisms.  The higher intent of this project is to create an IRC bot that hackerspaces around the globe will be mildly entertained upon deployment of this bot to their IRC channel, such that ultimately a network of hackerspaces can be queried and inspected via IRC network messages and ultimately through a slick https frontend or other convenient delivery mechanisms.

Features and units of code are welcome and well implemented if they lead up to AdventureChannel being closely similar to the way Final Fantasy games are done (in particular, FF2 SNES).  

Code is high quality if it is highly readable or if it is well documented meta-programming that saves hundreds of lines of code.  

Code is high quality if it makes considerations towards future development of the project, enabling an enjoyable future of continued maintenance and extension of and to this project.  

Features and units of code are high quality if they don't break existing tests unless those other tests passed in an architecturally flawed state of code and should be re-written anyway.

Features and units of code that don't break things, are non-malicious, and are out of the way should probably be accepted in good faith in the spirit of anarchy.
