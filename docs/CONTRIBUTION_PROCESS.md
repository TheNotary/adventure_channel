# The Contribution Process

Issue discussion and pull requests are welcome.  I'm just some guy, I can't say whether someone else's code art is good or not, but the project philosophy and this guide will (mostly objectively) be able to calculate if a PR is ready for merge, needs minor tweaks or needs to be approached differently for architectural purposes.  

#### How Code Contributions will be Handled

- Your PR will be merged automatically if your code is 95-100% perfect.  Also you're friggin excellent and possibly telepathic since 100% perfect implies you came to the exact solution that I would have and used the same exact variable names I would have used or have used in similar projects.  

- In cases where your PR is 80%-95% perfect Your PR will be respectfully tweaked (your contribution will NEVER be plagiarized unlike how some dick OSS maintainers do; you will continue always be marked as the author of your own commits).  If you leave a note such as `what do you think?` I won't conduct the tweaks on my own, instead I'll hastily write the tweaks as line notes to your PR and will hold off on making the tweaks myself until you either append to the PR yourself or give me the approval to do so on my own.  

- If there's something about the approach taken in the PR that doesn't fit into the grand puzzle that is AdventureChannel, I'll do my best to articulate the architectural constraints that preventing me from taking in the PR mostly as-is.  Hopefully
  1. my response is articulate enough to convince you of my view of the PR, and
  2. that's not too huge of a let down that you lose confidence and ambition in continuing to work on AdventureChannel.  

  If you think the architectural approach described in response to a PR is in error, please further the discussion on the issue until we're of a single mind.  This helpful [guide](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/blob/master/code-review/README.md) on code review should be adhered to ensure everyone stays happy.  Also note [the project's philosophy](docs/PROJECT_PHILOSOPHY.md) which ultimately will factor in what PRs are merged as-is/ tweaked/ put on hold/ or requested to be re-worked.
